# Node AES Encryption
A Node.js project to implement and test AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption and decryption for secure data handling.
## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to use AES encryption in Node.js to securely encrypt and decrypt data. It includes example scripts to test encryption workflows, suitable for applications requiring data security, such as chat apps or API payloads.
Features

- Encrypt and decrypt text using AES-256-CBC.
- Configurable encryption keys and initialization vectors (IV).
- Simple test scripts to verify encryption/decryption.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (included with Node.js)

## Installation

- Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/node_aes_encryption.git
- Navigate to the project directory:cd node_aes_encryption
- Install dependencies:npm install

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: Runtime environment.
- crypto: Built-in Node.js module for AES encryption.
- dotenv: For managing environment variables (optional).
